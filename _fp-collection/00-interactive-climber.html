<p>An Interactive Climber for Playnetic's new "Traditionals" product line. In this new product line Playnetic reimagined playground classics as innovative and interactive playground equipment.</p>

<p>This climber features interactive discs that are suspended in the air by chains with rubber sleeving. Positioned at different
  hights they create a dynamic climbing experience. De discs detect if pressure is applied to them
  and can respond with light, sound and haptic effects depending on what game is activated.</p>

<p>Playnetic playground equipment works on Human Power. Energy for the interactive elements of this climber
  is generated by turning the charging wheel. Because of this sustainable way of generating energy, Playnetic playground equipment does not
    have to be connected to the power grid.</p>
